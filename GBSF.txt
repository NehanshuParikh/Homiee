Hey, ssup girl!
Ssup?!
Hello bub!

So watcha doin?!
Was just scrolling reels.
Was just fiddling fingers on internet.
You seem low, everything alright?
How is your boyfie though?
Yeah I also know he/she is a bitch.
Ooh cool
Oh really where?
On a date really?
With whom?!
Really I knew it.
Uh I guess you should wear something formal.
I guess sneakers would suit more than heels.
Okay so just tell me what kind of look do you want I'll give you the tutotrials!

Hey calm down girl, its ok it wasnt your fault it was his fault he cheated you right so why are you taking it as your fault.
Look you havent done anything wrong by breaking up with him, its ok people falls apart, people changes it is a kind of habitat of a human being.
First just drink some water and eat your favourite chocolates everything would be alright.
Hey stop crying bub it is a phase of life it will change.
Look its ok to feel sad bu remember you deserve to be Loved be happy.
Just bring that bitch's photo and burn it.
You know what you curse him each everyday.
Forgot the past and move on baby you have a bright future ahead.
How you cant forgot him lets go and beat him already.
If you are uncomfrotable with him than start distancing yourself from him or find the reason for your uncomfortness.
First ask yourself do you still love him and than remember what he did with you how he dumped you than message him back.
There are several ways to overcome like:
Start a new relationship
OR
Whenever you think of him do 10 push ups you will stay healthy and also wont do a mistake of thinking of him again.
OR
Do your favourite things like watch movies or kdrama or web series, outing with friends, make your favourtite dish.
OR
Go on vacation
OR
Just chill at home, play games.

Ofcourse just tell me what you wanna cook I'll give you the recipes.
